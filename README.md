# 🐉 Pokemon Battle (Racket)

A functional Pokémon battle system implemented in **Racket (`#lang racket/base`)**.  
The project follows a **pure functional design**, using immutable data structures and explicit state transitions.

It is the counterpart to the object oriented Java version:
https://github.com/eleventozero/pokemon-battle-java

The goal was to implement the same idea twice:
- once in a functional style (Racket)
- once in an object-oriented style (Java)

## ✨ Features

- ⚔️ Turn-based battle system (Player vs Enemy)
- 🔁 Pure functional state management (no mutation)
- 🧠 Type effectiveness system (Gen 1 inspired)
- 💾 SQLite database integration
- 🧩 Modular architecture (API, DB, Logic, UI)

| name         | String | Name       |
| current-hp   | Int    | Current HP |
| base-hp      | Int    | Max HP     |
| base-attack  | Int    | Attack     |
| base-defense | Int    | Defense    |
| type         | Symbol | e.g.'fire  |
| attacks      | Vector | 3 attacks  |

### Attack

| Field  | Type   | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| name   | String | Attack name |
| damage | Int    | Base damage |
| type   | Symbol | e.g. 'water |

---

### State

| Field        | Description         |
|--------------|---------------------|
| player-team  | List of Pokemon     |
| enemy-team   | List of Pokemon     |
| p-active     | Player active index |
| e-active     | Enemy active index  |
| turn         | #t = player         |

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Status effects (poison, burn, etc.)
- Improved enemy AI (strategy instead of random)
- Extended type system (full Gen 1 mechanics)

## ⭐ Notes

This project is designed as a learning system to explore:

- Functional programming in Racket
- Clean architecture and separation of concerns
- Game logic implementation
- Database integration with SQLite
